## This is a full guide from learning _DSA_ and implementing Algorithm to solving problems from _SPOJ_ and _LEET CODE_

- Named the folder according to the algorithms. The actual implementation will be inside these folders

- For eg. Searching Algorithms contains linear search and binary search implementation.

- **_Python_** version followed is **_3.8.5_**
